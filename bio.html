						<p>â€œItâ€™s akin to the ancient art of Bonsai,â€ explains Bonn Oâ€™Brien between sips of house blend at a Brooklyn coffee shop. â€œIt takes patience. It takes an eye for detail. Itâ€™s reverence, respect, and a steady hand all rolled into one. Itâ€™s the only way to take care of a proper beard. We take the same approach to our music.â€</p>
						<p>Three years ago, the Oâ€™Brien-lead The Dapper Beards burst into the countryâ€™s collective consciousness like a Salvador Dali â€˜stache thanks to their now-iconic appearance on the cover of the trendy periodical â€œGarden and Gun.â€ â€œThe Beards Are Here, And They Will Save Folk Musicâ€ read the headline. The striking image of the 	four bandmates in repose, silhouetted by a SoHo sunset was an immediate viral sensation.</p>
						<p>â€œWe sued,â€ says Oâ€™Brien with a twist of his mustache, â€œthatâ€™s how it went viral. I donâ€™t think anyone had seen a bold move like thatâ€“ a band, suing to protect their image after signing off on the cover. We owe a big thanks to The Smoking Gun for making that happen. We had approved the cover, but we hadnâ€™t approved of the people who were going to be reading the magazine. Turns out they didnâ€™t approach that story with the kind of reverence with which we treat our beardsâ€“ the same approach we take to our musicâ€“ and we didnâ€™t appreciate that.â€</p>
						<p>And the Folk pigeonhole? Oâ€™Brien didnâ€™t take kindly to that, either.</p>
						<p>â€œThey never took the time to ask for the spelling. It may sound like the word that is commonly used to describe some kinds of roots music, but it wasnâ€™t the word that we were using. Itâ€™s not even the music weâ€™re doing. Folkâ€“ and thatâ€™s the only time Iâ€™m going to use that wordâ€“ is so over. Weâ€™re Fauxlk. Pronounced the same way as Folkâ€“ which, really, is the last time Iâ€™m going to use that wordâ€“ but itâ€™s spelled F-a-u-x-l-k. If youâ€™re not going to ask us about our music, which we take great care inâ€“ similar to the way in which we care for our beardsâ€“ how can we expect you to represent our movement in its proper context to your readers?â€</p>
						<p>The ever-serious Oâ€™Brien and his band cared not for the lucky breakâ€“ a musical outfit landing a cover on one of Americaâ€™s more respected musical magazines before ever releasing an album or staging a public performanceâ€“ if that break wasnâ€™t going to come on their own terms.</p>
						<p>â€œWe take great care in our music, which is also the way weâ€“ right, you said itâ€“ and weâ€™ll be damned if weâ€™re going to let some media machine run roughshod over us.â€</p>
						<p>With the lawsuit now fully behind them (it was thrown out of the only court that would hear the groundbreaking piece of litigationâ€“ a television courtroom show that is, as its producers kindly reminded us, indeed legally binding within the judicial system), The Dapper Beards are now looking towards the future.</p>
						<p>â€œWeâ€™re the foremost representatives of Fauxlk musicâ€¦ the face and beards of the movement, if you will. We take that responsibility very seriously, which is the same way in, well, yeah. So, yeah, weâ€™re seriousâ€</p>
						<p>And when will the world get to experience this movement firsthand?</p>
						<p>â€œSoon,â€ says Oâ€™Brien. â€œWeâ€™re thinking about writing our first song, and maybe even playing it at an open mic really soon. But itâ€™s not going to be one of those slapped-together open micâ€™s, mind you. Itâ€™s going to be a really serious one.â€</p>
